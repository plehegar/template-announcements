Dear Advisory Committee Representative,
[This announcement will be forwarded to W3C group chairs]

W3C is pleased to announce the (re)charter of the %%Group Name%%.
  %%CharterURI%%

The group is chartered through %%CharterEndDate%%.

@@(Summary of the group scope, e.g.,) The mission of the group ...@@

Please use the following form to have your organization join the group. The form will also instruct you how to nominate participants:
  %%JoinFormURI%%

Please consider diversity when proposing people to participate in W3C groups. Representation from a wider group of people, especially people from under-represented groups, is vital for creating web standards that meet the needs of the wider web community.

----@@For an existing group@@----
If your organization is currently in the group, please note that you will need to have it re-join the group as the new charter adds a new deliverable with licensing obligations under the W3C Patent Policy. This Call for Participation triggers the start of the 45 days grace period. See:
  https://www.w3.org/2020/09/15-pp-faq.html#recharter

[OR] Current participants are not required to rejoin this group because the charter includes no new deliverables that require W3C Patent Policy licensing commitments.

----@@For a newly created group@@----
The group plans to have its first major @@indicate: (virtual) or (face-to-face)@@ meeting in @@Month of first major meeting@@.
