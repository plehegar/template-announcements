Subject line for your mail to the W3C Comm Team <w3t-comm@w3.org>:
[draft] %%GroupName%% Charter extended until %%ExtensionDate%%
-------
Dear Advisory Committee Representative,
[This announcement will be forwarded to W3C group chairs]

The %%GroupName%% charter [1] is hereby extended until %%ExtensionDate%%.

[EDIT ME]
  Include real rationale here. In general, TILT should
  discuss rationale for the extension, and this rationale
  should be more than "in order to continue its work" or
  "it took longer than expected." 

  If the group is developing a new charter, link to the
  GitHub repo where a new WG charter is being developed and
  to the issues link to file feedback/suggestions. 
[/EDIT ME]

More information about the %%GroupName%% can be found on its summary page [2], including information about group Chairs, Staff Contacts and instructions for joining the group.

[REMINDER]
  Remind Staff Contact to follow instructions regarding in-place charter update at extension:
  https://www.w3.org/guide/process/charter.html#extension-request
[/REMINDER]

If you have any questions or need further information, please contact %%StaffContactName%% &lt;%%ContactEmail%%&gt;, Staff Contact for the %%GroupName%% Working/Interest Group.

This extension follows section 4.6 of the W3C Process Document:
  https://www.w3.org/policies/process/drafts/#charter-extension
 
Thank you,

For Philippe le Hegaret, W3C Strategy and Project Lead,
%%StaffContactName%%, %%GroupName%% ;
Xueyuan Jia, W3C Marketing &amp; Communications
