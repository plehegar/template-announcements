10</a> (Acknowledgment of a Submission Request) of the W3C Process
Document explains the significance of the Team's acknowledgment:</p>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <strong>
    Making a Member Submission available at the W3C Web site does not
    imply endorsement by W3C, including the W3C Team or Members. The
    acknowledgment of a Submission request does not imply that any action
    will be taken by W3C. It merely records publicly that the Submission
    request has been made by the Submitter. A Member Submission made
    available by W3C must not be referred to as “work in progress” of W3C.
